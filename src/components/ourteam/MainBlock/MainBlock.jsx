        The iContribute team has decided to launch the much awaited iContribute volunteer platform in the upcoming month
        of September and has already gained over 9 to 10 views on their linkedin page. Analysts have expected this
        product of the company to bring a positive change in the future generation of the Ottawa community. In the year
        2014, when it became apparent that the mobile development community was in the midst of creating a volunteer
        platform, quite a few companies decided to create their own volunteer platforms on their own to compete with the
        tech giant in the volunteer industry. Among the many companies who launched their customized versions of
        volunteer platforms, Point, was the one of the prominent companies who was successful in producing and providing
        a variety of resources within a very short period of time. iContribute, remains the giant of those that watch.
