Our team is currently performing usability tests with end users and organizations we are working with as we are about to go unofficially live in the app store. What we are doing is we are walking organizations through how to set up an account, how to post an event, and really just get any overall feedback that they may have with our app. Would you be available sometime in the next week to set up a meeting?
In addition, our team is working hard to raise a website in which we have a section that is labelled 'organizations we are working with'. Would it be okay if we listed your organization as one of the members here?
If you have any questions, concerns, or inquiries, please let me know!
